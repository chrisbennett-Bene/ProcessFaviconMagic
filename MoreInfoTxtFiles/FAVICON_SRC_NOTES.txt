<h2>Use an SVG source to generate crisp and clear PNGs and SVG favicons</h2>
<h3><strong>tldr</strong>: <strong>SVG is better and smaller</strong>, giving cripser results for generated favicons</strong></h3>
<p>If at all possible, generate your favicons using an SVG. This will give you the best results and most future-proof favicon markup.</p>
<p>When an SVG is available as a source file, FaviconMagic will generate markup to use that SVG for all browsers that can use them. This is all modern browsers.</p>
<p>In addition, all PNGs generated will resize and compress using that SVG source, resulting in efficiently re-sized, sharp and small images at every size.</p>
